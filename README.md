# About the dataset
We introduce a large image dataset called **Face Masks Detection** for training a neural network to solve reidentification tasks. This dataset consists of a collection of high-quality photographs capturing individuals wearing medical masks. These images have been curated and compiled into a comprehensive dataset to aid in various machine learning and computer vision applications. 

The photographs showcase diverse *gender, age, and ethnic groups, allowing for a broad spectrum of representation.*

The dataset featuring photos of people wearing medical masks provides a valuable resource for various machine learning and computer vision applications. With its diverse subjects, comprehensive annotations, high image resolution, this dataset encourages advancements in *facial recognition, emotion analysis, and healthcare research, among other potential applications*.

The dataset consists of **75,283** sets of images (**301,132** images in total) from people from **160** countries. The data for the dataset is still gathering, so the number of photos is getting bigger!

### The dataset includes 4 different types of images:
- **Type 1** - no mask on the face.
- **Type 2** - mask is on, but does not cover the nose or mouth.
- **Type 3** - mask covers the mouth, but does not cover the nose.
- **Type 4** - mask is worn correctly, covers the nose and mouth.

### Data in the dataset
- People from 18 to 81 years old are presented in the dataset.
- For each person in the dataset age, country and gender is presented.
- The data was mostly collected indoor, however there are also selfies made outdoors.
- The lighting is artificial, natural daily lightning, evening outdoor lighting and dark indoor lighting.
- People provided selfies where the head takes up at least 1/2 of the frame.
- Distance from the camera is approximately 20-30 centimeters.
