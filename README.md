# About the dataset

The **"Portrait and 26 Photos"** dataset is a comprehensive collection of images showcasing the daily life of individuals, consisting of a personal selfie and 26 accompanying photos captured during various activities. This rich dataset aims to provide researchers, developers, and individuals with a diverse and detailed set of visual information to facilitate the development and improvement of computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition algorithms.

The photographs showcase diverse *gender, age, and ethnic groups, allowing for a broad spectrum of representation.*

The selfie and daily life photos dataset offers numerous potential applications, including but not limited to: *facial recognition software training, security verification, emotional analysis, driver identification and other*.

The dataset consists of **272** sets of images (**7,344** images in total) from people from **26** countries. 

### The dataset includes 2 different types of images:
